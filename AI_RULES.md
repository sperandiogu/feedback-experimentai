# AI Development Rules for Experimenta√≠ Feedback App

This document provides guidelines for the AI assistant to follow when developing and modifying this application. The goal is to maintain code quality, consistency, and simplicity.

## Tech Stack Overview

This is a modern web application built with the following technologies:

-   **Framework**: React (using Vite for a fast development experience).
-   **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
-   **Backend & Database**: Supabase is used for the PostgreSQL database and backend APIs.
-   **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (specifically Google Provider) is used for user sign-in.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for all styling. We do not use plain CSS, CSS-in-JS, or other styling libraries.
-   **UI Components**: The project uses pre-built, accessible components from **shadcn/ui**, located in `src/components/ui`.
-   **Icons**: All icons are provided by the `lucide-react` library.
-   **Animations**: UI animations and transitions are handled by `framer-motion`.

## Library Usage and Architectural Rules

To ensure the codebase remains clean and maintainable, please adhere to the following rules:

### 1. Component Development

-   **Use shadcn/ui First**: For common UI elements like buttons, cards, inputs, etc., always use the existing components from `src/components/ui`.
-   **Create New Components**: For any custom, reusable UI logic, create a new component file inside `src/components`. Do not add new components to existing files.
-   **Styling**: **Only use Tailwind CSS classes for styling.** Do not write custom CSS files or use inline `style` objects unless absolutely necessary for dynamic properties that cannot be handled by Tailwind.

### 2. Data and State Management

-   **Database Interaction**: All database operations **must** go through the Supabase client defined in `src/lib/supabase.ts`.
-   **Service Layer**: Abstract database logic into service classes within the `src/entities` directory (e.g., `EditionService`, `Feedback`, `User`). Components should call these services instead of directly calling Supabase functions.
-   **State Management**: For now, use React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`). Do not introduce state management libraries like Redux or Zustand unless the application's complexity grows significantly.

### 3. Authentication

-   **Authentication Provider**: Firebase Authentication is the sole method for user authentication.
-   **Auth Hook**: Use the `useAuth` hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`) as the single source of truth for the user's authentication state. All components that need user information should consume this hook.

### 4. Icons and Animations

-   **Icons**: Exclusively use icons from the `lucide-react` library. Do not install other icon libraries.
-   **Animations**: Use the `framer-motion` library for all UI animations to ensure consistency.

### 5. Code Structure

-   `src/components`: Reusable React components.
-   `src/components/ui`: Pre-built shadcn/ui components. Do not modify these directly.
-   `src/entities`: Service classes and logic for interacting with database tables (e.g., User, Edition).
-   `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useAuth`).
-   `src/lib`: Initialization and configuration for third-party libraries (e.g., Supabase, Firebase).
-   `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions, especially for database structures.

By following these rules, we can ensure the application remains simple, elegant, and easy to maintain.
